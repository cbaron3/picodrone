# Final Board V2

Improvements from V1 will include:

- Shift more resistors and capacitors to the bottom side of the board to allow for a smaller board
- Remove the reset button to save more space because it is not really required
- Use an NRF24 mini breakout board instead of the regular component because it is actually quite small compared to what I could design and antennas are somewhat tricky to design
- Remove an LED; less LEDs less power usage
- Increase top and bottom silkscreen text size because its too small to read
- Consider swapping to KiCAD for free 4 layer designing
